Difficulties Encountered:
Importing this dataset into MySQL Workbench did not present major difficulties, 
as the dataset appears to be well-structured with clear column headers and consistent data types (e.g., integer, varchar). 


Interesting Observations:
One interesting thing about this dataset is the diversity in demographic and behavioral attributes captured:

Age and Gender: The dataset includes a range of ages and genders, including non-binary individuals.
Time Spent: Indicates the time spent on various social media platforms.
Location and Demographics: Shows different locations (United Kingdom, United States, Australia) and demographic profiles (urban, sub-urban, rural).
Profession and Income: Profiles various professions (software engineer, student, marketer manager) and income levels.
Ownership and Indebtedness: Details ownership status (home, car) and financial information (indebtedness).
