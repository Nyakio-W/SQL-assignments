Difficulties Encountered:
Importing this dataset into MySQL Workbench might not present major difficulties, 
as the dataset appears to be well-structured with clear column headers and consistent data types (e.g., integer, varchar). 
However, depending on the specific MySQL setup and configurations, there could be challenges related to handling large datasets efficiently, ensuring data integrity during import,
and optimizing queries for performance if the dataset grows significantly.
